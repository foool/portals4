Portals4 on Infiniband
Quickstart guide
2011/5/25

-= This is a work in progress =-

Pre-requisite
  * openmpi 1.4.x or 1.5.x: the test program is MPI based, and
    starting a task necessitate mpirun.
  * only if using XRC: OFED 1.5.2 with patches to librdmacm (see
    patches/rdmacm-xrc-v?.diff). patches/rdma-bw-xrc-v?.diff is not necessary,
    but allows to test XRC+RDMA CM with the rdma_bw test.
  * libev-4.0.4 (or similar), available at
      http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html
  * the KNEM driver from http://runtime.bordeaux.inria.fr/knem/. Ensure that /dev/knem is readable/writable by the user running the portals software. 

Build:
  * ./autogen.sh
  * i686: 
      ./configure CFLAGS="-march=i686 -I/usr/lib/openmpi/include/" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib/openmpi/lib/"
  * x86_64:
      ./configure CFLAGS="-I/usr/lib/openmpi/include/" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib/openmpi/lib/"
    or:
      ./configure CFLAGS="-I/usr/lib64/openmpi/1.4-gcc/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib64/openmpi/1.4-gcc/lib"
  * add --enable-xrc if XRC support is desired.
  * make

Test:
  * cd test
  * standalone tests:
      mpirun  -H localhost ./test_all.sh
  * with 2 ranks:
      mpirun  -H localhost -n 2 ./test_all_2_ranks.sh
  * make_test_relay.pl can build a special script for a given amount
    of ranks. Use mpirun to start the test:
      -  ./make_test_relay.pl  > test_relay.xml
      -  mpirun  -H localhost -n 9 ./ptl_test -f test_relay.xml 

Testsuite note:
The testsuite is testing both error paths and good paths. However when
the library is configured with --enable-fast (such as built from the
RPM), most parameter checks are disabled. As a result a lot of the
negative tests cannot pass (or make the program crash).  There is 2
solutions there:
  - either do not configure with --enable-fast
  - configure with --enable-fast but undefine NO_ARG_VALIDATION in config.h

Building an RPM:
  * make dist       --> this will create portals-4.0.tar.gz
  * rpmbuild -ta portals-4.0.tar.gz

If mpi is in a non standard path, add CFLAGS and LDFLAGS to rpmbuild, such as:
   CFLAGS="-I/usr/lib64/openmpi/1.4-gcc/include" LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib64/openmpi/1.4-gcc/lib 


Limitations:
  * A program may not open more than one NID in its lifetime.
