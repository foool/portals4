Portals4 on Infiniband
Quickstart guide
2011/5/25

-= This is a work in progress =-

Pre-requisite
  * openmpi 1.4.x or 1.5.x: the test program is MPI based, and
    starting a task necessitate mpirun.
  * only if using XRC: OFED 1.5.2 with patches to librdmacm (see
    patches/rdmacm-xrc-v?.diff). patches/rdma-bw-xrc-v?.diff is not necessary,
    but allows to test XRC+RDMA CM with the rdma_bw test.
  * libev-4.0.4 (or similar), available at
      http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html
  * the KNEM driver from http://runtime.bordeaux.inria.fr/knem/. Ensure that /dev/knem is readable/writable by the user running the portals software. 

Build:
  * ./autogen.sh
  * i686: 
      ./configure CFLAGS="-march=i686 -I/usr/lib/openmpi/include/" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib/openmpi/lib/"
  * x86_64:
      ./configure CFLAGS="-I/usr/lib/openmpi/include/" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib/openmpi/lib/"
    or:
      ./configure CFLAGS="-I/usr/lib64/openmpi/1.4-gcc/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib64/openmpi/1.4-gcc/lib"
  * add --enable-xrc if XRC support is desired.
  * make

Test:
  * cd test
  * standalone tests:
      mpirun  -H localhost ./test_all
  * with 2 ranks:
      mpirun  -H localhost -n 2 ./test_all_2_ranks
  * make_test_relay.pl can build a special script for a given amount
    of ranks. Use mpirun to start the test:
      -  ./make_test_relay.pl  > test_relay.xml
      -  mpirun  -H localhost -n 9 ./ptl_test -f test_relay.xml 

Limitations:
- A program may not open more than one NID in its lifetime.
