Quickstart guide

-= This is a work in progress =-

Pre-requisite
* openmpi 1.4.x or 1.5.x: the test program is MPI based, and starting a task necessitate mpirun.
* OFED 1.5.2 with patches to librdmacm (see patches/rdmacm-xrc-v?.diff). patches/rdma-bw-xrc-v?.diff is not necessary, but allows to test XRC+RDMA CM with the rdma_bw test.
* libev-4.0.4 (or similar), available at http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html

Build:
* ./autogen.sh
* i686: ./configure CFLAGS="-march=i686 -I/usr/lib/openmpi/include/" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib/openmpi/lib/"
* x86_64: ./configure CFLAGS="-I/usr/lib/openmpi/include/" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib/openmpi/lib/"
* make

Test:
* cd test
* killall control; mpirun --mca mpi_warn_on_fork 0 --mca btl_openib_warn_default_gid_prefix 0 -H localhost -n 2 ./ptl_test -f ./test_put.xml
* with several nodes: pdsh -w "puff[3,4]" killall control; sleep 1; mpirun --mca mpi_warn_on_fork 0 --mca btl_openib_warn_default_gid_prefix 0 -H puff3,puff4 -n 2 -x PORTALS4_MASTER_NID=192.168.221.13 ./ptl_test -f ./test_put.xml

Limitations:
- A program may not open more than one NID in its lifetime.
- There is a hardcoded limit of 200 nods with 10 ranks each.
- If mpirun is started on a node not part of the cluster, then
  PORTALS4_MASTER_NID must be set to indicate which node will host the
  master control process.
